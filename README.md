# Temperature Monitoring System (Simulated)

This project simulates a basic temperature monitoring system for an embedded environment. The system reads data from a simulated temperature sensor and controls an LED based on temperature thresholds.

### Project Structure
- **main.c**: Contains the main application logic.
- **sensor.h / sensor.c**: Simulated temperature sensor.
- **led.h / led.c**: Simulated LED control.

### Features
1. Simulates reading temperature from a sensor.
2. Controls an LED based on temperature thresholds:
   - If temperature exceeds 30°C, the LED turns on.
   - If temperature goes below 10°C, the LED turns off.
3. Temperature values and LED status are printed on the terminal.
